Which area should i pick? What neighbourhood? \nI was faced with this task about 3 years ago when I was moving to Toronto for work. Unfortunately, at that point of time I didn't have enough of data science knowledge to automate the search process, thus, decision was made based on lots and lots of manual research. However, having all this valuable Python knowledge, let's try to see how I could have tackled this problem. "

With some little tweaks to the process - this can become quite valuable and, most importantly, time saving way to arrive to final decision. \n3. And, of course, my fellow Data Analysts and Data Scientists, who are looking to analyze the neighborhoods of any city, in my case - Toronto, using a variety of techniques to reach desired results and draw subsequent conclusions.

We will scrape this page, get the data we need and create a pandas dataframe. A bit of assumptions:\n<br> 1.1. The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood.\n<br> 1.2. We will only process the cells that have an assigned borough. We shall ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned. \n2. A CSV file that has the geographical coordinates of each of Toronto's postal codes: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data. We will use this link to obtain needed data and create new dataframe containing following columns:\n    - Postal Code\n    - Borough\n    - Neighbourhood\n    - Lattitude\n    - Longitude  \n3. We also will be using Foursquare API to obtain needed information on the venues in the neighborhoods of Toronto. The API returns a JSON file and we will be transforming it into a dataframe for our analysis."
